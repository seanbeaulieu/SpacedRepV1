# Spaced Repetition Vocabulary Notification App
- Adjustable Interval Notifications on Desktop / Mobile for vocabulary
- This app is intended to be a desktop client for a vocabulary service that will passively remind you of selected terms and definitions. The user will be able to input words and definitions, select any amount of those terms, and choose an interval for the app to ping the user's desktop in the background with the word. One possible extension to this is the quiz feature, where the notificationw will instead link back to the app and quiz the user on the meaning of thet term (or vice versa).
- This app will be developed with the .NET 7 framework using C#.
